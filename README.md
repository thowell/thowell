### Hi, I'm Taylor!

PhD candidate at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) working with the [Robotic Exploration Lab](https://roboticexplorationlab.org/) on motion planning for robots. I am interested in open and reproducible research and building useful and performant tools for robotic systems. 

Currently working on:
- fast [model-predictive control](https://github.com/thowell/ContactImplicitMPC.jl) algorithms 
- [differentiable simulators](https://github.com/thowell/RoboDojo.jl) for rigid-body dynamics with contact.
