### Hi, I'm Taylor!

My work is focused on **embodied intelligence** for robotics. Relevant work includes:
- [GPU optimized physics engine](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp) for robotics
- [interactive predictive control](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco_mpc) for locomotion and manipulation
- [differentiable physics](https://github.com/thowell/RoboDojo.jl) for rigid-body dynamics with contact
- [non-convex solvers](https://github.com/thowell/CALIPSO.jl) for planning with conic and complementarity constraints
- [predictive control algorithms](https://github.com/thowell/ContactImplicitMPC.jl) algorithms for robots that make and break contact with the environment
