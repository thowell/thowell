### Hi, I'm Taylor!

Research Scientist Intern @ [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/) and PhD candidate at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) working with the [Robotic Exploration Lab](https://roboticexplorationlab.org/) on optimization tools, differentiable physics engines, and control for robots. I am interested in open and reproducible research and building useful and performant tools for robotic systems. 

Currently working on simulation, planning, and control:
- [differentiable physics](https://github.com/thowell/RoboDojo.jl) for rigid-body dynamics with contact
- [non-convex optimization solvers](https://github.com/thowell/CALIPSO.jl) for robotic systems
- [model-predictive control](https://github.com/thowell/ContactImplicitMPC.jl) algorithms for robots that make and break contact with the environment

Previously:
- research intern at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/robotics/)
- undergraduate researcher [Telerobotics Lab](https://www.telerobotics.utah.edu/)
- robotics instructor [University of Utah Computer Science GREAT summer camp](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~dejohnso/GREAT/)
- undergraduate researcher [State of Utah Center of Excellence for Biomedical Microfluidics](https://mems.utah.edu/)
