### Hi, I'm Taylor!

Currently looking for Research Scientist positions in industry.

My research focus is **embodied intelligence** via high-performance optimization. Recently, I have been working on:
- [interactive predictive control](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco_mpc) for locomotion and manipulation
- [differentiable physics](https://github.com/thowell/RoboDojo.jl) for rigid-body dynamics with contact
- [non-convex solvers](https://github.com/thowell/CALIPSO.jl) for planning with conic and complementarity constraints
- [predictive control algorithms](https://github.com/thowell/ContactImplicitMPC.jl) algorithms for robots that make and break contact with the environment
