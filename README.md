### Hi, I'm Taylor!

Currently looking for Research Scientist positions in industry.

My research focus is **embodied intelligence** via high-performance optimization. Recently, I have been working on:
- [interactive predictive control](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco_mpc) for locomotion and manipulation
- [differentiable physics](https://github.com/thowell/RoboDojo.jl) for rigid-body dynamics with contact
- [non-convex solvers](https://github.com/thowell/CALIPSO.jl) for planning with conic and complementarity constraints
- [predictive control algorithms](https://github.com/thowell/ContactImplicitMPC.jl) algorithms for robots that make and break contact with the environment

Previously:
- PhD at Stanford University with Zac Manchester and the [Robotic Exploration Lab](https://roboticexplorationlab.org/)
- research scientist intern at [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/) on MuJoCo simulation team
- research intern at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/robotics/)
- undergraduate researcher [Telerobotics Lab](https://www.telerobotics.utah.edu/)
- robotics instructor [University of Utah Computer Science GREAT summer camp](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~dejohnso/GREAT/)
- undergraduate researcher [State of Utah Center of Excellence for Biomedical Microfluidics](https://mems.utah.edu/)
